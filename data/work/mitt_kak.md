Mitt Käk is an app for iOS and Android that helps reduce the food waste in schools and saves the environment at the same time. With the app the students gets to choose their prefered dishes from a predefined weekly menu, and that way the kitchen knows just how much food they have to cook and deliver to the schools.

I've worked on the later releases for the iOS-version of the app, both on the client and backend.
