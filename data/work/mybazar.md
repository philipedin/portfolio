The Cask Owner Web was for High Coast Whiskey to let cask owners have more control over their casks.

The system was created as an React app on the frontend and with a .Net Core backend. We used Typescriupt in the client app to make sure of less bugs and to make it a more friendly coding experience. We decided to try Styled Components as the approach to style components.
